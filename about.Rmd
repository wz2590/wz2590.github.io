## **EXPERIENCES**  
#### **Bioinformatics Engineer Intern, Apr 2021-Aug 2021**  

*Simcere Pharmaceutical – Department of Bioinformatics*  

* Developed new techniques and approaches that are being used by the company as building-blocks for cancer liquid biopsy products. Examples:  
  * Computational pipelines to excavate cell-free DNA fragmentation phenotypes of various cancers from next generation sequencing data;  
  * Gradient boosting classifier to distinguish the blood cfDNA sequencing data from cancer patients and healthy control. Used cross-validation to evaluate the classifier’s performance.  
* Conducted literature search. Used Microsoft Word and PowerPoint to present the latest journal articles related to liquid biopsy of cancer to department colleagues in the weekly journal club.  
  
#### **Neuroscience Research Intern, Sep 2019-Apr 2021**  
*The Scripps Research Institute - The Maximov Lab*
  
Research objective: understand how the reconstruction of synaptic networks of specific areas of mice brain correlates to memory storage.  
Contributed significantly to the publication on Cell Reports: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.108953  

* Produced 3D rendered images of neuron structures with Blender. These images served as illustration figures in the published paper;  
* Wrote python scripts in Blender to assist statistical classification of dendritic spines;  
* Used Excel and MATLAB to perform statistical analysis of the shape and density of neuron network;  
* Used VAST (Volume Annotation and Segmentation Tool) to trace neurons and their organelles.  
  
  
## **SKILLS**
